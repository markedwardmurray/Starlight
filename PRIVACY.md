**Starlight Congress â€” Call the House & Senate**  
January 9, 2017


This version of the Starlight app does not record any location information. Some data received from the API will be persisted locally to save on network requests. Choosing to save your legislators only stores them locally on your device. Starlight does not transmit any activity information with the exception of necessary fields provided to the Sunlight API. Developer analytics may be added in a future release, but these will not record personally-identifying information (PII). The project's source code is available on GitHub for public scrutiny.
