##### Description

Starlight is a simple reference tool for staying informed about upcoming legislation in the United States Congress and easily accessing the phone numbers of your local representative legislators. The first time you open the app it will prompt you to find your legislators with either your device's location or by entering your home address. Saving your legislators will make them accessible to call directly from a bottom toolbar which will show their names. Upcoming bills can be viewed as a list, and selecting one will open a PDF of its latest version hosted by the US Government Publishing Office ( gpo.gov ).

Because phone calls are significantly more effective than social media or email, only the legislators' office phone numbers are accessible through the app. Tap on a representative's name to start a call to their Washington DC office.

Starlight is powered by the Sunlight Labs Congress API, which provides data publicly listed in the United States Congress directory maintained on GitHub at https://github.com/unitedstates/contact-congress . The app's congressional contact information will be as up-to-date as these resources upon which it depends.
