### Starlight Congress - Call the House & Senate

Starlight is a simple reference tool for staying informed about upcoming legislation in the United States Congress and easily finding the phone numbers of your local representative legislators in order to contact them. The app will search for legislators based on your current location, and other searches can be made by entering an address in the search bar. Upcoming bills can be viewed as a list, and selecting one will open a PDF of its latest version hosted by the US Government Publishing Office ( gpo.gov ).

Because phone calls are significantly more effective than social media or email, only the legislators' office phone numbers are accessible through the app. Tap on your representative's name to start a call to their Washington DC office.

Starlight is powered by the Sunlight Labs Congress API, which provides data publicly listed in the United States Congress directory maintained on GitHub at https://github.com/unitedstates/contact-congress . The app's congressional contact information will be as up-to-date as these resources upon which it depends.

Starlight is not affiliated with Sunlight Labs. To learn more about the Sunlight Foundation and other open government resources, please visit sunlightfoundation.com , govtrack.us , and congress.gov .
