### Starlight

Starlight is a simple reference tool for finding the phone numbers of your local representative legislators in the United States Congress. The app will begin a search with your current location, and other searches can be made by entering an address in the search bar.

Because phone calls are the most effective means for contacting congress, only the office phone numbers are accessible through the app. Tap on your representative's name to start a call.

Starlight is powered by the Sunlight Labs Congress API, which provides data publicly listed in the United States Congress directory maintained on GitHub at https://github.com/unitedstates/contact-congress . The app's congressional contact information will be as up-to-date as these resources which it depends upon.

Starlight is not affiliated with Sunlight Labs. To learn more about the Sunlight Foundation and other open government resources, please visit www.sunlightfoundation.com and www.govtrack.us .

This version of the Starlight app does not record any location, search, or activity information in any form. Developer analytics may be added in a future release, but these will not record personally-identifying information. The project's source code is available on GitHub for public scrutiny.
